Uncharted Waters:New Horizons Randomizer

I.  Motivation
I have fond memories of the Uncharted Waters fanchise, and while I did not play New Horizons until the mid 2000s I was quite impressed with its ability to evoke a sense of exploration and discovery.  Now, imagine being able to randomize the world map, port placement, items, etc.  In addition, you could rename everything, to sail, trade, and discover in a world entirely of your own creation.  Enter Uncharted Waters:New Horizons Randomizer, which promises such an experience.

Note: There is no command line utility for this randomizer; only a UI version. I will only make a command-line one available should there be a demand for it.

II. General Flags
Version 1.0 allows for map randomization.  Select a number of continents, number of islands, and polar ice thickess.  The randomizer will generate a map and replace the in-game mini-map with the newly generated map.  Randomizing the map eliminates the rectangle of "Known world" available on the original map.

You can randomize your starting ship.  It's most likely to be beneficial for everyone except for Catalina (who starts with a Galleon!)  Your initial ship crew, provisions, and any cargo remain unchanged.

New in ver 1.02:  You can randomize the starting price indeces for all ports.  All port good type sub-indeces are randomized and the port's general price index is derived from those sub-indeces.

New in ver 1.03:  You can randomize port types.  Randomizes the goods and buy/sell prices in all ports.  Note: Because this enforces that all goods are available either in a market type or as a specialty, and that no port sells a specialty that is already available in its market type, there is a small chance that specialty goods in ports may change.

You can also decide to view the game's Mini-map upon generation of the ROM.  A small window showing what is essentially the game's minimap pops up when the ROM is generated.  (Alternatively, you can start the game "completely blind")

Also, the randomizer creates a "makeLog.txt" and "diffreport.txt" file that is used for debugging purposes when a ROM is generated.  MakeLog logs activity of the rom generator and Diffreport lists byte-by-byte changes to the ROM from the original.

New in ver 1.10:  The known world is now visible on the minimap from the beginning of the game.  You can now turn off storms occurring in this region, so that you don't start off in a region full of storms.

You can turn off ship build times for new ships, so they will be available for use right when you order them.  You can turn on 24/7 availability for shops and port services, so you don't need to wait or visit inns to wait for things to open.

Also, more roms should generate, and slightly faster, as I reworked some of the ROM memory placement and port placement.  Also, all villages and ports should now be accessable (Before there was a slight chance of a port being inaccessable; the new algorithm is faster and eliminates the possiblity of an inaccessible port or village).

III. Theme generation
World themes allow customization of the Uncharted Waters world by allowing to rename all ports, kingdoms, map regions, and commodities.

To edit a theme, go to the Theme tab and select a category.  You can rename things one-by-one on the list or use the batch edit feature to open a table that can be used to change all entries.

Kingdom names, region names, discoveries, supply ports and commodities can only be renamed.  Ports can be renamed and have their market types, shipyard types, specialty good, and cultural tileset edited and/or randomized.  

You can save themes using the UI.  Themes are saved to the Randomizer's directory using the .thm extension.

Notes:
-Kingdom names in the original game are Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Italy, Englad and Holland.  Items pertaining to those kingdoms (the Letter of Marque and Tax-Free Permit) have a prefix indicating the Kingdom's first initial.  The randomizer will change this indicator according to the first initial of the new Kingdom name.  Also note that the randomizer will automatically change the Turkish items names to start with (T) instead of (O) due to this algorithm.
-Cultural (graphical) tileset pertains to the tileset used to generate buildings at the port.  See the randomizer for a listing of the different ones.  Capitals and the port Mecca require the palace tileset, so choices for tileset at those ports are limited to European Shingle, European Wood and Middle Eastern.
-I have found that changing the tileset (culture) of capitals may cause a softlock right at the start of your game.  If you have problems with this, don't change the graphical tileset of capitals.
-Further port look changes were achieved by applying a "possible palette" change applicible at different lattitudes.  Striking examples include the Chinese tileset in desert (tropical) regions and the Caribbean Hut tileset in boreal/arctic regions.
-Port music is tied to the market type of the port, not the port's graphical tileset.  I may change this in future versions.
-Ports with their specialty goods changed will have their buy prices changed to 75%-200% of the price they would normally be bought for (based on that port's original market type), skewed toward roughly 106%.  (This is to avoid Lubeck situations).  Required market investment is also redone based on the good.
-Changing Port names, discoveries, etc. does not currently change their references in story text.  I plan this to be fixed in future versions.


Editing .thm files:
Theme files are simple text files that can be edited via a text editor.  The format is as follows:
[Kingdoms]
...List of Kingdom names and proper adjectives, one per line

[Areas]
...list of trade areas, one per line

[Ports]
...list of port names, followed by numbers listing that port's market type, shipyard type, specialty good, and cultural tileset, separated by a semicolon (;).  One port per line.
Example: vanilla Lisbon is listed as Lisbon;1;1;17;1 as Lisbon has market type A, shipyard type A, Rock Salt as specialty good, and the European Shingle tileset

Notes:
-Valid values for Market type range from 0 (interpreted as Random) to 13 (based on the 13 trade regions).  
-Valid values for Shipyard type range from 0 (Random) to 10.  The randomizer identifies the best ship you can get at the given shipyard type.  (Example: 10.Tekkousen)
-Valid values for Port Specialty range from -1 (None) to 46 (wood).  Again, 0 is interpreted as Random.
-Valid values for Port cultural tileset range from 1 to 9.  Again, capitals (and Mecca) will be changed to 1,2, or 4 randomly if set to other values.

[Supply Ports]
...list of supply port names, one per line

[Discoveries]
...list of discovery names, one per line
Notes:  
-Changing this does not currently change discovery text; only the name of the discovery
-Spaces and the dash indicate a line break.  The randomizer's algorithm for handling these is to put a second line after the break if the first line would exceed 16 characters in the word after the break.  This differs from the original game's line break placement in some cases.

[Commodities]
...list of commodity names, one per line
Notes:
-Spaces and the dash indicate a line break.  The randomizer's algorithm for handling these is to put a second line after the break if the first line would exceed 8 characters in the word after the break.  This differs from the original game's line break placement in some cases.


IV.  Known issues (bugs) 
-Junk may appear at the top edge of the game minimap.  This started happening when I allowed maps to have more than 490 minimap tiles.  (It's better than invalidating the ROM IMHO).
-There may be small, random black spots on the game overworld.  (I don't know what causes this)
-There is a (very) minimal chance that ports may be placed in an inaccessible location. (Should be fixed in ver 1.04)
-The game may softlock if you change the graphical tileset ("Culture") of capitals. (Again, the solution is to simply leave those alone).
-This version has not been completely tested as of this release.  Thus, randomizing the map may make the game impossible to beat.  
 (Especially for Pietro, who needs to sail from Genoa to Lisbon right at the start of the scenario).

V.  Future development
I am releasing this relatively untested version of the randomizer to simply test the demand, and at this time my energy is needed on other projects.  However, the following future development is planned for this randomizer:
- Editing and randomization of more in-game data, such as mates, ship data, treasure names, etc.
- A "Charter vessel" system.  Through the Marco Polo bank, you will be able to assign ships in your fleet to remote trade routes.  Those ships will leave your fleet and go to the assigned trade routes, get the assigned commodity, and trade with other assigned ports.  Get lots of mates and ships to build your world trade empire.
- A game script editor.  Edit game script to create your own stories with the main sailors of the game.  (I have ideas for game story scripts I would like to implement so stay tuned).
- A replacement of that stupid card-based Captain-to-Captain battle system with something more action-oriented.  (Think Defender of the Crown style swordplay)
Again, this is all based on time but this is the long-term vision of the Randomizer.
