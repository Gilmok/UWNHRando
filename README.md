Uncharted Waters: New Horizons randomizer for the SNES

Version 1.0
-Randomize the world map and your initial ship
-Option to view minimap of newly created world
-Theme editor allows you to rename Kingdoms, trade regions, all ports, discoveries, and commodities
-Randomize port market types, shipyard types, specialty good and graphical tileset (a.k.a. "culture")

Known issues:
-Junk may appear at the top of the in-game minimap.
-There is a (very) minimal chance that ports may be placed in an inaccessible location.
-The game may softlock if you change the graphical tileset ("Culture") of capitals.
-Randomizing the map may make the game impossible to beat.  
 (Especially for Pietro, who needs to sail from Genoa to Lisbon right at the start of the scenario).
